## Visit count for pod0

kubectl exec pod/flask-app-manual-flask-0 -- cat visits.txt

## Visit count for pod1

```text
kubectl exec pod/flask-app-manual-flask-1 -- cat visits.txt
6
```

Difference is that each pod has its own unique environment e.g. storage and network and are independent of each other. Which pod is accessed decided by load balancing.

Ordering is crucial to ensure proper consistency and overall robustness of the system. 0 indexed pod should always be active first, so that other replicas will syncronize its data properly.

A way to implement parallel operations is to add this line in `statefulset.yaml`

```text
podManagementPolicy: Parallel
```
